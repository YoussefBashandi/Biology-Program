/**
*   Title: Biomolecular converter
*   Version: 1.0 (Beta)
*   Authors: Youssef mohamed , Youssef hassan , Yassien Ahmed
*   Last Modified Date: 13/12/2018
*   Purpose: Works with different types of sequences (DNA, RNA, Protein) and can transform any
*   of them to any other type of sequence and finds the longest common sequence.
*
*   Change log:
*   v 0.0:
*   -Implemented parent class and designed the UML
*
*   V (0.1):
*   -Designed the protein child class and the CodonsTable
*   -Added exception handling
*
*   V 0.2:
*   -Designed the DNA child class
*   -Added exception handling
*
*
*   V 0.3:
*   -Designed RNA child class and added files
*   -Overridden operators
*
*   V 0.4:
*   -Added alignment
*
*   v 0.5:
*   -Fixed bugs and logical errors
*
*   v 0.901:
*   -Added the ability to align two sequences
*   -Added the ability to get all possible DNA strands from one big protein sequence
*
*   v 0.974:
*   -Fixed bugs and issues and improved performance
*
*   v 1.0(BETA):
*   -Added UI
*   -Uploaded code to github
